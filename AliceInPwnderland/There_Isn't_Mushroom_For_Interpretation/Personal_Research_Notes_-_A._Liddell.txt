Personal Research Notes - A. Liddell
=====================================

Day 3 in Pwnderland:
The mushrooms here are unlike anything in Oxford's botanical gardens. I've been documenting everything I can find, but the Caterpillar's advice keeps echoing in my mind.

Key observations:
- Red-capped specimens seem to cluster near the Mad Hatter's domain
- Blue-stemmed varieties prefer the shadows of the Cheshire Cat's tree
- Golden specimens only appear during the "unbirthday" hours
- Purple bell-shaped fungi ring the Queen's croquet grounds

The Caterpillar spoke in riddles, as always. His warning about the "White Death" was particularly chilling. Something about ancient symbols and facing mortality. I can't shake the feeling that there's a deeper meaning to his words.

Note to self: Research the connection between death symbolism and hidden knowledge. The pirates used certain symbols for a reason - perhaps there's a code hidden in plain sight?

The way he emphasized that final symbol... almost like he was trying to tell me something without saying it directly. In Pwnderland, everything has multiple meanings.

Must investigate further. The answer feels close, hidden in the conversation itself.

UPDATE: I keep thinking about his final words - "the very symbol of danger holds the key to everything." What symbol was he referring to? The skull and crossbones? Something else entirely?

The more I think about it, the more I believe the answer isn't in the mushrooms themselves, but in the WARNING about them...
